# Data Scraping with UiPath RPA

This repository contains a **UiPath RPA (Robotic Process Automation)** project designed to perform **data scraping** from web pages. The bot extracts structured data from websites and stores it in a predefined format (such as Excel, CSV, or a database). The goal of this project is to demonstrate the power of **UiPath RPA** in automating repetitive tasks like web scraping.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use **UiPath** to automate the process of scraping data from a website. The UiPath robot extracts specific information from the site, such as product details, pricing, or contact information, and stores it in an easily usable format for further analysis.

The bot performs the following tasks:
1. Navigates to the target webpage.
2. Scrapes the required data from the page.
3. Extracts the data into a structured format (e.g., CSV, Excel).
4. Stores the output data in a predefined file or database.

## Features

- **Data Extraction**: Scrapes structured data from web pages (e.g., product names, prices, descriptions).
- **Automation**: Fully automates the scraping process without human intervention.
- **Flexible Output**: Supports multiple output formats, including Excel, CSV, or database.
- **Error Handling**: Includes error handling for common scraping issues like broken links or data formatting problems.
- **Scalability**: Can be adapted for scraping multiple pages or websites.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **UiPath Studio**: You need **UiPath Studio** installed on your machine. You can download it from the official [UiPath website](https://www.uipath.com/start-trial).
   
2. **UiPath Robot**: The robot is required to execute the automation process. If you have UiPath Studio, you can directly execute it with the Robot.

3. **Web Browser**: Make sure the **UiPath Web Scraping** activities are compatible with the browser you're automating (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

4. **Target Website Access**: Ensure that the website you want to scrape is publicly accessible and does not have restrictions like CAPTCHAs, login forms, etc. If necessary, set up login credentials for the scraping bot.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
